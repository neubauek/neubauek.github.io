I wanted to share the tools and techniques that I use to assemble my surface mount prototypes. The below video details all of the tools I use for initial assembly (not rework) and the steps taken. In putting this info out there, I hope to prevent some people from having some of the same learning curve headaches and issues that I had when first transitioning from through hole soldering to surface mount.

Enjoy!

By the way, the board featured in this video is the [CircuitBrains Deluxe](/projects/circuitbrains-deluxe/). The final hours of its [Crowd Supply campaign](https://www.crowdsupply.com/null-byte-labs/circuitbrains-deluxe) are running out. Itâ€™s so close to funding! If you would like to get your hands on one, go put in a pledge!
