### Purpose:
An educational toy… No, really. That’s why I created it. That and to have something to break the ice at tech conferences that I go to. My badge is inspired by the [Adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333), has some [Adafruit HalloWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3900) elements thrown in, plus a cheap OLED and the [#BadgeLife SAO connector](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/20/introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v1-69bis-standard/).

### Features:
 * Runs [Adafruit CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/)!
 * Atmel ATSAMD51J19 ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller
 * 8 MB flash storage
 * Accelerometer
 * Speaker/Buzzer
 * SK6812 LEDs / Neopixels
 * BadgeLife SAO connector
 * Three buttons
 * AA battery holder

### Bill of Materials:
See the BOM XLSX and interactive HTML BOM within the “Kicad files” folder in my [GitHub](https://github.com/neubauek/CircuitPythonBadge).

### Links:
 * [My GitHub](https://github.com/neubauek/CircuitPythonBadge) contains the hardware schematic and board layout in Kicad format
 * The [CircuitPython Virtual Pet](/projects/circuitpython-virtual-pet/) program I wrote
