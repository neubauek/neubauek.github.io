I decided I would so something fun with it, which will hopefully make it into its own post after finishing it. At first I wondered about doing something with the audio clips that were stored on the toy. Of course, after opening it up there’s a big blob of black epoxy over the microcontroller.</description><dc:creator>Kevin Neubauer</dc:creator><media:content url="https://kevinneubauer.comimages/SeeNSay/See-N-Say-1-150x150.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>hardware hacking</category><category>hardware</category><category>electronics</category></item><item><title>Cyber City Circuits Assembly Service Review</title><link>https://kevinneubauer.com/posts/cyber-city-circuits-assembly-service-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><atom:modified>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 12:00:00 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://kevinneubauer.com/posts/cyber-city-circuits-assembly-service-review/</guid><description>There exists a black hole somewhere in between “I’m going to assemble those 30 boards by hand” and “I need to work directly with a fab in China to assemble hundreds of boards”. This “small business maker” market seems to have a lack of contract fabricators willing to assemble projects at a reasonable cost. Presumably, this market isn’t profitable for them due to the variability of each job and overhead of part orders and tooling changes.</description><dc:creator>Kevin Neubauer</dc:creator><media:content url="https://kevinneubauer.comimages/HardwareAssembly/CB_Top-150x150.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>hardware assembly</category><category>hardware</category><category>electronics</category></item><item><title>Update – Panelizing Your Circuit Design With KiCad</title><link>https://kevinneubauer.com/posts/panelizing-for-kicad/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Sep 2020 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><atom:modified>Sun, 06 Sep 2020 12:00:00 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://kevinneubauer.com/posts/panelizing-for-kicad/</guid><description>Open source and knowledge sharing are so important. They enable the community as a whole to efficiently learn and to improve on others work. After spending several hours figuring out how to panelize KiCad circuits for small production runs, I published this post and accompanying video then didn’t put a second thought into how I could make the process more efficient. However, thanks to knowledge sharing, tools and techniques improve over time.</description><dc:creator>Kevin Neubauer</dc:creator><media:content url="https://kevinneubauer.comimages/Panelizing/CB-Deluxe-Panel-150x150.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>kicad</category><category>hardware</category><category>electronics</category><category>panelizing</category></item><item><title>Surface Mount Electronics Prototype Assembly How-To</title><link>https://kevinneubauer.com/posts/surface-mount-electronics-prototype-assembly-how-to/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><atom:modified>Wed, 13 May 2020 12:00:00 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://kevinneubauer.com/posts/surface-mount-electronics-prototype-assembly-how-to/</guid><description>I wanted to share the tools and techniques that I use to assemble my surface mount prototypes. The below video details all of the tools I use for initial assembly (not rework) and the steps taken. In putting this info out there, I hope to prevent some people from having some of the same learning curve headaches and issues that I had when first transitioning from through hole soldering to surface mount.</description><dc:creator>Kevin Neubauer</dc:creator><media:content url="https://kevinneubauer.comimages/HardwareAssembly/HardwareAssembly-150x150.png" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>hardware assembly</category><category>hardware</category><category>electronics</category></item><item><title>Panelizing Circuit Designs with Kicad</title><link>https://kevinneubauer.com/posts/panelizing-circuit-designs-with-kicad/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><atom:modified>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 12:00:00 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://kevinneubauer.com/posts/panelizing-circuit-designs-with-kicad/</guid><description>Update: For a super simple method of generating the panel framework, please see this blog post update.
Original blog post below:
Recently I had some Twitter followers ask me how I panelized my CircuitBrains Deluxe design for smaller home production runs. KiCad has little built-in support for panelizing so prepare for a little work getting set up. However, the good news is that you can put in a little work on getting a reference panel created for your design.</description><dc:creator>Kevin Neubauer</dc:creator><media:content url="https://kevinneubauer.comimages/Panelizing/CB-Deluxe-Panel-150x150.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>kicad</category><category>hardware</category><category>electronics</category><category>panelizing</category></item></channel></rss>
