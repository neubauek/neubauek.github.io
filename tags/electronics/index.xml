It may not make any sense at all, but hear me out and follow it (provided it doesn’t have a high probability of bodily harm). In these instances, your brain is telling you that you need to do something different, something fun, and perhaps something creative.</description><dc:creator>Kevin Neubauer</dc:creator><media:content url="https://www.kevinneubauer.comimages/SeeNSay/SnS_Hacked_Outside_Graphics-150x150.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>CircuitBrains</category><category>CircuitPython</category><category>project</category><category>electronics</category><category>hardware</category><category>hardware hacking</category><category>toy</category></item><item><title>See ‘N Say Audio Files – Convert Speaker Output to Microphone Input</title><link>https://www.kevinneubauer.com/posts/see-n-say-audio-files-convert-speaker-output-to-microphone-input/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><atom:modified>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 12:00:00 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://www.kevinneubauer.com/posts/see-n-say-audio-files-convert-speaker-output-to-microphone-input/</guid><description>I picked up a cheap See ‘N Say toy at a thrift store a while back. I decided I would so something fun with it, which will hopefully make it into its own post after finishing it. At first I wondered about doing something with the audio clips that were stored on the toy. Of course, after opening it up there’s a big blob of black epoxy over the microcontroller.</description><dc:creator>Kevin Neubauer</dc:creator><media:content url="https://www.kevinneubauer.comimages/SeeNSay/See-N-Say-1-150x150.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>hardware hacking</category><category>hardware</category><category>electronics</category></item><item><title>Cyber City Circuits Assembly Service Review</title><link>https://www.kevinneubauer.com/posts/cyber-city-circuits-assembly-service-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><atom:modified>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 12:00:00 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://www.kevinneubauer.com/posts/cyber-city-circuits-assembly-service-review/</guid><description>There exists a black hole somewhere in between “I’m going to assemble those 30 boards by hand” and “I need to work directly with a fab in China to assemble hundreds of boards”. This “small business maker” market seems to have a lack of contract fabricators willing to assemble projects at a reasonable cost. Presumably, this market isn’t profitable for them due to the variability of each job and overhead of part orders and tooling changes.</description><dc:creator>Kevin Neubauer</dc:creator><media:content url="https://www.kevinneubauer.comimages/HardwareAssembly/CB_Top-150x150.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>hardware assembly</category><category>hardware</category><category>electronics</category></item><item><title>Update – Panelizing Your Circuit Design With KiCad</title><link>https://www.kevinneubauer.com/posts/panelizing-for-kicad/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Sep 2020 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><atom:modified>Sun, 06 Sep 2020 12:00:00 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://www.kevinneubauer.com/posts/panelizing-for-kicad/</guid><description>Open source and knowledge sharing are so important. They enable the community as a whole to efficiently learn and to improve on others work. After spending several hours figuring out how to panelize KiCad circuits for small production runs, I published this post and accompanying video then didn’t put a second thought into how I could make the process more efficient. However, thanks to knowledge sharing, tools and techniques improve over time.</description><dc:creator>Kevin Neubauer</dc:creator><media:content url="https://www.kevinneubauer.comimages/Panelizing/CB-Deluxe-Panel-150x150.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>kicad</category><category>hardware</category><category>electronics</category><category>panelizing</category></item><item><title>Surface Mount Electronics Prototype Assembly How-To</title><link>https://www.kevinneubauer.com/posts/surface-mount-electronics-prototype-assembly-how-to/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><atom:modified>Wed, 13 May 2020 12:00:00 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://www.kevinneubauer.com/posts/surface-mount-electronics-prototype-assembly-how-to/</guid><description>I wanted to share the tools and techniques that I use to assemble my surface mount prototypes. The below video details all of the tools I use for initial assembly (not rework) and the steps taken. In putting this info out there, I hope to prevent some people from having some of the same learning curve headaches and issues that I had when first transitioning from through hole soldering to surface mount.</description><dc:creator>Kevin Neubauer</dc:creator><media:content url="https://www.kevinneubauer.comimages/HardwareAssembly/HardwareAssembly-150x150.png" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>hardware assembly</category><category>hardware</category><category>electronics</category></item><item><title>Panelizing Circuit Designs with Kicad</title><link>https://www.kevinneubauer.com/posts/panelizing-circuit-designs-with-kicad/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><atom:modified>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 12:00:00 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://www.kevinneubauer.com/posts/panelizing-circuit-designs-with-kicad/</guid><description>Update: For a super simple method of generating the panel framework, please see this blog post update.
Original blog post below:
Recently I had some Twitter followers ask me how I panelized my CircuitBrains Deluxe design for smaller home production runs. KiCad has little built-in support for panelizing so prepare for a little work getting set up. However, the good news is that you can put in a little work on getting a reference panel created for your design.</description><dc:creator>Kevin Neubauer</dc:creator><media:content url="https://www.kevinneubauer.comimages/Panelizing/CB-Deluxe-Panel-150x150.jpg" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>kicad</category><category>hardware</category><category>electronics</category><category>panelizing</category></item><item><title>CircuitBrains Basic</title><link>https://www.kevinneubauer.com/projects/circuitbrains-basic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 16:10:00 -0500</pubDate><atom:modified>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 16:10:00 -0500</atom:modified><guid>https://www.kevinneubauer.com/projects/circuitbrains-basic/</guid><description>Summary: CircuitPython on an ARM Cortex M0 in 1 square inch!

I decided that I would write a Tamagotchi-like clone, similar to the Tamaguino (for Arduino).
The little pet is capable of eating, getting agitated, playing a game, and yes, even pooping…
All of the audio and artwork assets are included and easily replaceable for those who want to create their own pet.

That’s why I created it. That and to have something to break the ice at tech conferences that I go to. My badge is inspired by the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, has some Adafruit HalloWing elements thrown in, plus a cheap OLED and the #BadgeLife SAO connector.
Features: Runs Adafruit CircuitPython!
